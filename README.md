### Project Summary  

Building Energy Simulation through Deep Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning has proved to be a successful optimization technique to find optimal behaviors in the absence of relevant data and learning for the experience.  
In this project, we propose to optimize and control dynamic power consumption in a building by means of Reinforcement learning techniques. To do so, we will rely on an existing testbed and will use different datasets.
